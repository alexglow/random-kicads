LAYERS
Silkscreen: WANT = black
	Cut out the parts that would go over copper
Solder mask: Entire thing = black (DON'T want)
Copper: hardware, strings
Edge.Cut: pick outline, hole

* set up silkscreen in Inkscape
* pull it into Photoshop; edit the copper layer (in black) and size both
* pull BOTH silkscreen & copper into kicad
* block solder mask (F.Mask)

WON'T do silks over no mask

Make little video of LED testing
